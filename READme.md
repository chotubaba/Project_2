## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Views and Functions

**Logout Function (`logout_view`)**

  Handles user logout and redirects to the login page.

**Operations Functions (`getBalance` and transaction operations in `BalanceOperationsView`)**

  - **`getBalance(user)`**: Calculates the user's balance based on deposit and withdrawal history.
  - **`BalanceOperationsView Class`**: Handles both GET and POST requests for balance operations.
  - **`get(self, request)`**: Retrieves the user's balance and renders the `operations.html` template.
  - **`post(self, request)`**: Processes deposit and withdrawal operations based on form input, updates history, and renders the updated balance in the template.

**Create User (`CreateUserView`) and Login (`CustomLoginView`)**

  - **`CreateUserView`**: Utilizes `CreateView` to handle user registration using the `User` model and `CreateUserForm`.
  - **`CustomLoginView`**: Extends `LoginView` to customize login behavior and context data.


**Main Menu (`MainMenuView`)**

  Displays the main menu template (`main_menu.html`) with the user's username if authenticated.


**Transaction History (`ViewTransactionHistoryView`)**

  Displays the transaction history for the logged-in user, sorted by date.


**Currency Exchange (`CurrencyExchangeView`)**

Provides functionality to convert an amount from one currency to another using an external API:
  - **API Endpoint**: [Currency Exchange API](https://fake-api.apps.berlintech.ai/api/currency_exchange)
  - Handles GET and POST requests, validates form data, retrieves currency rates, and computes the exchanged amount.

  ```

4. **Apply Database Migrations**
  ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

** Create a Superuser (Optional for Admin Access) **

    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
** Usage : Run the Development Server **

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

**Access the Application**

    Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```bash
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

5. **Connecting to DBeaver for SQLite Queries**
        - Open DBeaver and create a new SQLite connection.
        - Navigate to the Database File:
        - Click on Database > New Database Connection.
        - Choose SQLite.
        - Browse to the db.sqlite3 file located in the project root directory.
        - Connect and execute queries against your SQLite database as needed.

6. **Testing**
**Running All Tests : **
    To run all tests in the project, execute:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py test
    ```

**Testing Specific Components**
    To test individual models, methods, classes, or templates, specify the path to the test module. 
    For example, to test the ViewTransactionHistoryView:

    ```bash
    python3 manage.py test app.tests.test_TransactionHistoryView
    ```


7. ** Adding __pycache__ Files to .gitignore **
    __pycache__ files are generated by Python to store bytecode-compiled versions of your Python files.

- To prevent these files from being tracked by Git, ensure your .gitignore file includes the following line:

    ```bash
    __pycache__/
    ```

- ** Remove Existing __pycache__ Directories from Git Tracking **


    Step 1: Add __pycache__ to .gitignore
    ```bash
    echo "__pycache__/" >> .gitignore
    ```

    Step 2: Remove __pycache__ directories from Git tracking
    ```bash
    find . -name "__pycache__" -type d -exec git rm -r --cached {} +
    ```

    Step 3: Commit the changes

    ```bash
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Add __pycache__ to .gitignore and remove from tracking"
    ```

    Step 4: Push the changes
    ```bash
    git push origin branch_name
    ```

8. **Security:**
Review and implement Django's built-in security features such as CSRF protection (csrf_token), authentication (LoginRequiredMixin), and validation checks (e.g., amount <= 0, invalid operations).
